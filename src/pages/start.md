# Welcome to Team Tech Project!

Team Tech Project is a monthly meetup for club members interested in gaining experience working in a team, as well as building up their portfolio with awesome projects.

Each month, members come together to form teams, build awesome projects, and share what they built the following month. Every team that presents their project will earn a spot on the club website in the [Team Tech Project gallery](/gallery)!

## How does it work?
