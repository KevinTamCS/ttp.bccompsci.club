## How does Team Tech Project work?

Each month, members come together to form teams, build awesome projects, and share what they built the following month. Every team that presents their project will earn a spot on the club website in the [Team Tech Project gallery](/gallery)!

In addition, members also vote on a suggested project theme every month to use as a guiding point for next month's projects. The project theme is not a requirement and is just a starting point for members that need some inspiration. Build whatever you and your team desires!

## Get Started

Now that you know about how Team Tech Project works, let's begin!

### Forming Your Team

The first thing to do is to find a team to work with! Team Tech Project is a collaborative effort that works best with teams of 4-5 people, but you can work alone if you prefer to. There are two main ways to build your dream team:

#### Post on our Discord Community

The Computer Science Club's Discord community is a great way to discover and find team members to work with. Post a team-up request in the `#ttp-team-building` channel to begin.

Not a member of our Discord community and/or the club yet? [Join the club here for the Discord invite link!](https://bccompsci.club/join)

#### Attend Monthly Meetups

After the previous month's presentations are finished, team formation for the following month's project begins. This is the best time to find team members to work with, as others will be looking for a team too!

The next monthly meetup is **October 13, 2020**. Register for the next meetup [here!](https://bccompsci.club/events/5/team-tech-project-october)
