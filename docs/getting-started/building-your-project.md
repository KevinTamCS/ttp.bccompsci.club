title: Building Your Project
---

After you have formed a team, you and your team can start deciding on what project work on!

## Coming Up With an Idea

At each meetup, we all vote on a suggested project theme for the month to use as a starting point. Keep in mind that this theme is only a _suggestion_, and you aren't required to follow it for your project. Build whatever you and your team want to!

This month's theme is **Health**!

If you aren't sure what to build for your project, consider using the theme as a starting point and think about ways to solve problems that fit the theme. For example, if the theme is education, one possible idea would be something that helps to make the lives of students easier, perhaps maybe a homework to-do list or a flashcard app.

## Use Your Tools

To help you while you build your project, we compiled a [list of useful tools and resources](/docs/resources/tools) that you can use! Some of these tools include domains to host your project on, credits to deploy your project to the cloud, tools to help you while you develop, and many more. Use these tools to build, test, and deploy your project to the world.

## Getting Help

If you or your team ever get stuck with your project and need help, just ask in the `#programming-help` channel on our Discord community, and the friendly community can help you out.
