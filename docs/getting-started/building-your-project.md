title: Building Your Project
---

After you have formed a team, you can start deciding on what to work on with your team! At each meetup, we all vote together on a suggested theme for the month.

This month's theme is **Health**!

If you aren't sure what to build for your project, consider using the theme as a starting point and think about ways to solve problems in the theme. For example, if the theme is education, one possible project would be to build something that helps to make the lives of students easier, perhaps maybe a homework to-do list or a flashcard app.
