### What if I've never written a line of code before?

That's OK! You should register anyway! We'll have plenty of resources and a few workshops in the coming weeks to get you up and running. If you ever get stuck on something, you can always ask for help in `#programming-help` on our Discord community.

### What if I don't have a team?

During the event, we will have a team formation session where you can find other members to work with.

### How big can my team be? Can I work alone?

There isn't a hard cap on team sizes, but we recommend 4-5 members at most per team. You can also work alone if you prefer, but we strongly recommend working on a team!

### What types of projects can I build for Team Tech Project?

Anything! Whether you want to build a web app, a Java command line program, a game, a hardware project, or anything else, the only limit is your imagination.

### My question isn't answered here! What should I do?

If you have a specific question about the event itself, send us an email at teamtechproject@bccompsci.club, but if you have a general question, try asking on our Discord community.
