### What if I've never written a line of code before?

That's OK! We have a collection of [free learning resources](/docs/resources/learn) to help you get up and running. If you ever get stuck on something, you can always ask for help in `#programming-help` on our Discord community.

### What if I don't have a team?

Post a team-up request in `#ttp-team-building` on our Discord community! In addition, during each meetup, we will have a team formation session where you can find other members to work with.

### How big can my team be? Can I work alone?

There isn't a hard cap on team sizes, but we recommend 4-5 members at most per team. You can also work alone if you prefer, but we strongly recommend working on a team since you won't get the full experience of Team Tech Project without a team!

### What types of projects can I build for Team Tech Project?

Anything! Whether you want to build a web app, a Java command line program, a game, a hardware project, or anything else, the only limit is your imagination.

### My question isn't answered here! What should I do?

If you have a general question about Team Tech Project, try asking in `#ttp-general` on our Discord community. If you have an important or personal question, send us an email at teamtechproject@bccompsci.club.
