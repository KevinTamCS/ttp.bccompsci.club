title: How Team Tech Project Works
---

At its core, Team Tech Project is all about creating, learning, and growing as a team. Each month, members come together to form teams, build awesome projects, and share what they built throughout the past month at our monthly meetups. Every team that presents their project will earn a spot on the club website in the [Team Tech Project gallery](/gallery)!

In addition, members also vote on a suggested project theme each month to use as a guiding point for new projects. The project theme is not a requirement and is just a starting point for members that need some inspiration. Build whatever you and your team desires!

## Types of Projects

Your project can be anything you want it to be, such as a:

- Web App
- Java Command Line Program
- Video Game
- Hardware Project
- Smart Fridge
- Alexa Skill
- Minecraft Mod
- etc.

The most important thing is that you enjoyed building your project and learned something new from it.

## Working on Your Project Over Time

As long as you and your team started a new project specifically for Team Tech Project, you can continue to work on that same project for future meetups and present updates about your project as it evolves.

Don't feel pressured to rush to finish your project before each meetup! If you don't feel like you can complete your project before the next meetup, that's OK! Just present your current progress with the project and continue working on it for the next meetup.
