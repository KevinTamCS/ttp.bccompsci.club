Now that you know about Team Tech Project, let's begin!

The first thing to do is to find a team to work with. Team Tech Project is a collaborative effort that works best with teams of 4-5 people, but teams can be of any size. You can work alone if you prefer to, but we don't recommend it since you won't get the full experience of Team Tech Project. Besides, youâ€™ll have to work in a team in the real world anyway!

Your team can can consist of both Brooklyn College students and CUNY students from other CUNY colleges. Team sizes and members can also change freely between meetups and presentations. We encourage teams to welcome members of all skill levels to their team! Team Tech Project is a learning experience, and everyone benefits from working with team members with different areas of expertise.

New to the field of computer science or have team members that are new? We have a collection of great courses and tutorials to help you and your team get up and running [over here](/docs/resources/learn)! If you or your team ever get stuck with your project and need help, just ask in the `#programming-help` channel on our Discord community, and the community can help you out.

There are two main ways to build your dream team:

#### Post on our Discord Community

The Computer Science Club's Discord community is a great way to find team members to work with. To get started, post a team-up request or respond to an existing request in the `#ttp-team-building` channel.

Not a member of our Discord community and/or the club yet? [Join the club here to gain access!](https://bccompsci.club/join)

#### Attend Monthly Meetups

After presentations are finished during each meetup, team formation for the next month's project begins. This is the best time to find team members to work with, as other new members and existing teams will be looking for team members as well, and you can form a team quickly during the team formation session!

The next monthly meetup is in **Mid-November**. Check the website's homepage soon for more details about the next meetup!
